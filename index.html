		<p>Luft was founded by Blair Smith and Justin Rodriguez and aims to bring exceptional Nicaraguan coffees to the forefront of American coffee culture whilst redefining the paradigms that will forge its future. With complete vertical integration, Café Integral is a coffee company with an approach that stems from the grower’s perspective and sees the coffee through from shrub husbandry to the moment the beverage is served.</p>
